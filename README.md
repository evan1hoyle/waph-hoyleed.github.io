## Overview and Requirements 

In this project we created a website as a digital resume with a bunch of included features we have learned thoughout the course. I learned how to create, set and read cookies, a very important skill in web development. 

## Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud

At first I struggled getting this working but was able to set it up using online guides. 

## WAPH html

I used this (https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav) template to create a page to introduce the course.

## clock and show hide email

I copied the code from lab2 for this but had some issues getting the hide email working and had to consult online resources but got it working. 

## joke api

Reused the code for lab 2 and intergrated smoothly.

## cookies

I struggled with the cookies alot. For one the cookies wont set when going to the file locally creating alot of frustration. but using a onlien stackover flow post (
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20723236/displaying-a-welcome-message-if-a-cookie-is-set) I was eventually able to get the cookies to work as intended.
